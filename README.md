These are just some goofy little things I made up.

TTT.R plays Tic Tac Toe with you

Sudoku.R solves Sudoku puzzles and maintains a record
of multiple iterations.

Audioscript.R plays music.

NormDist.R has functions to determine the chances of 
outcomes from a given number of coin flips. It will
also plot normal distribution using that function.

I hope y'all enjoy! :-)
